# keshi – Inside Out

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I try to run away
And end up racing towards you
From all of my mistakes
To the sweetest sound
I can't recall the days
The life I had before you
Oh darling if I stayed
Could it be awhile
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way
It's you baby you're
all that I can think about
You baby
you got me turning inside out
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way
Everything is changing
You're rewriting pages
Yeah you come crashing in
like a dream
that I can't stop chasing
And everything's about you
My heart is where you take it
I'm home when you're around
no matter what the place is
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way
It's you baby you're
all that I can think about
You baby
you got me turning inside out
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way
(It's you baby you're all
that I can think about
You baby
you got me turning inside out
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way)
(It's you baby you're all
that I can think about
You baby
you got me turning inside out
What can I do
What can I say
I never knew
that I could feel this way)
